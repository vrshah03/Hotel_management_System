# Hotel_management_System

First of all in any hotels, there should be availability of beds so for that in beginning of project we have created rooms as per requirement of customers and allocate the floor to them with their room number.

Secondly, we have added the customer details by their name, address,check in date,check out date and provide them rooms which is available as per records found.

On the backend , we have created database named ‘hotel’ and created customers, rooms table with their appropriate rows and columns.

We can show the customers detail in the database with their allotted room id, room number and we can also get information about their name, address,check in date, check out date.
